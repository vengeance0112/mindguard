You are continuing an existing student mental health risk prediction web app built with a Logistic Regression model trained on 51 features.
The prediction pipeline already works and produces a risk category: Low, Medium, or High.

Your task is to extend the POST-PREDICTION RESULT PAGE ONLY by adding a deep, explainable, and human-centric insights section, without changing the trained model or feature set.

🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

After a prediction is shown, the dashboard should clearly explain:

Why this specific risk level was predicted

Which inputs increased risk

Which inputs reduced risk

What exact behaviors or conditions are concerning

What the student can realistically improve

Who they can reach out to immediately

This must feel like Explainable AI + causal reasoning, not a black-box score.

🧠 SECTION 1: Explainable Risk Breakdown (CORE)

Create a new section titled:

“Why You Got This Result”

This section must:

Pull actual model coefficients

Match them with the user’s inputs

Rank the top 5 positive (risk-increasing) and top 5 negative (protective) contributors

UI REQUIREMENTS

Horizontal bar chart

Red bars = factors that increased risk

Green bars = factors that reduced risk

Bar length proportional to contribution magnitude

Tooltip on hover explaining:

Feature name

User’s input value

Model impact direction

Simple explanation in plain English

Example tooltip text:

“High Academic Pressure: Your selected level was high, which strongly increases predicted risk based on patterns learned from similar profiles.”

🔍 SECTION 2: Causal Insight Cards (Human Explanation)

Add a grid of Insight Cards, auto-generated from the top contributing features.

Each card must follow this structure:

Title:
“Academic Pressure is a Key Risk Factor”

Cause:
“Your reported academic pressure level is above average and strongly associated with higher distress in the model.”

Effect:
“This contributes significantly to your overall mental health risk score.”

Why this matters:
“Sustained academic pressure often correlates with stress, sleep issues, and emotional burnout.”

Generate 3–5 cards dynamically, based on the strongest contributors.

🛠 SECTION 3: Personalized Improvement Suggestions (Actionable)

Create a section titled:

“What You Can Improve Right Now”

Rules:

Suggestions must be directly mapped to negative contributors

No generic mental health advice

Each suggestion must reference a specific input

Example Logic Mapping

High screen time → Suggest screen hygiene

Low sleep hours → Suggest sleep routine

No support network → Encourage reaching out

High stress → Suggest structured breaks or counseling

UI FORMAT

Checklist style cards

Each card includes:

Problem identified

Why it matters

One small realistic step

Example:

“Your sleep duration is below recommended levels. Increasing sleep by even 30–45 minutes daily may significantly reduce stress-related risk.”

📊 SECTION 4: Visual Risk Composition

Add a Risk Composition Visualization:

Options:

Donut chart showing:

Academic factors

Lifestyle factors

Psychological factors

OR stacked bar showing contribution categories

Each segment must be clickable and reveal:

Features inside that category

Their individual impacts

🧭 SECTION 5: Confidence and Uncertainty (Make it Honest)

Replace fake confidence scores.

Add:

“Model Confidence: Moderate / High”

Short explanation:

“This prediction is based on patterns from 10,000 similar student profiles. Individual experiences may vary.”

This increases credibility.

❤️ SECTION 6: Support & Emergency Resources (CRITICAL)

After insights, add a clearly visible support section.

Must include:

National mental health helpline (India):

Kiran Helpline: 1800-599-0019

Campus counseling note (generic if unknown)

Emergency disclaimer:

“If you are feeling unsafe or overwhelmed right now, please seek immediate help.”

UI STYLE

Calm colors

Non-alarming

Not hidden at bottom

🎨 VISUAL & UX REQUIREMENTS

Dark mode consistent with existing theme

Smooth animations when insights load

Skeleton loaders while computing insights

No medical diagnosis language

Tone must be:

Supportive

Neutral

Non-judgmental

🚫 IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT retrain the model

Do NOT introduce new ML models

Do NOT add AI chatbots

All explanations must be derived from:

Logistic Regression coefficients

User inputs

No fake statistics or hallucinated science

🧪 FINAL CHECK

After implementation, ensure:

Two users with different inputs see different explanations

Insights change if inputs change

Visuals reflect actual coefficients

Language feels human, not robotic

✅ END GOAL

The final result page should feel like:

“This system understands why you might be struggling, shows it transparently, and gently guides you toward help.”

Not just a prediction.
