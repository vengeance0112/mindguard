You are building a frontend-only interactive analytics dashboard for an academic machine learning project titled:

“Student Mental Health Risk Prediction Dashboard”

This project is part of an end-term Hackathon evaluation and must strictly align with:

An existing Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing:

Synthetic dataset generation

Feature engineering (51 features)

Mutual Information ranking

Logistic Regression and Random Forest models

Final selected model: Logistic Regression

Performance metrics: Accuracy 0.851, Macro F1 0.732, ROC-AUC 0.925, LogLoss 0.358

A trained Logistic Regression model saved as a .pkl file

The dashboard is not for production deployment.
It is an academic visualization and interaction layer that demonstrates:

Understanding of the data

Understanding of the model

Interpretability

Ethical framing

Practical usability

⚠️ Important constraint:
Do NOT invent new ML logic.
Do NOT retrain models.
Do NOT introduce deep learning, NLP, or external APIs.
Everything must be derived from the existing notebook and model outputs.

🎯 OBJECTIVE OF THE DASHBOARD

Create a highly polished, hyper-interactive, realistic-looking dashboard UI that demonstrates how the trained model could be used in a real institutional setting without claiming medical diagnosis.

The dashboard must visually and interactively cover exactly what the question paper demands:

Problem context

Major insights from data

Model behavior and factors influencing prediction

Visual analytics

Prediction interface

Ethical care framing and support information

🧱 TECH STACK CONSTRAINTS

Frontend only

Use HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Use Chart.js or ECharts for charts

Use modern dark UI

Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

No backend logic beyond loading .pkl results or mock prediction responses if needed

Assume prediction output is already available after submission

🧭 DASHBOARD STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
1️⃣ Landing / Overview Page

Create a premium hero section with:

Title: Student Mental Health Risk Prediction

Subtitle: “AI-assisted early risk identification using behavioral and psychological indicators”

Highlight cards:

10,000+ Training Samples

51 Input Features

3 Risk Levels

Model Accuracy: 85.1%

CTA buttons:

“Start Risk Assessment”

“View Analytics”

Include a short disclaimer:

“This system is an early-warning analytical tool and not a medical diagnosis system.”

2️⃣ Multi-Step Prediction Flow (Core Feature)

Design a 3-step wizard-style assessment:

Step 1: Lifestyle Metrics

Age

Study Hours

Sleep Hours

Screen Time

Outdoor Activity Hours

Use sliders with live numeric feedback.

Step 2: Personal & Support Information

Gender

Academic Level

Who the student talks to about problems

Openness to mental health discussion

Use radio buttons and dropdowns.

Step 3: Psychological Scales (1–5)

Academic Pressure

Stress Level

Sleep Issues

Hopelessness

Financial Comfort

Institutional Support

Use labeled scale selectors with semantic labels:
(1 = Very Low, 5 = Very High)

After Submission:

Simulate prediction output using:

Risk Category: Low / Medium / High

Risk Probability %

Color-coded result card

Simple explanation text:

“This prediction is based on learned patterns from similar profiles.”

🚨 POST-PREDICTION CARE SECTION (VERY IMPORTANT)

Immediately after showing prediction, display a Support & Care Panel.

This must include:

If Medium or High Risk:

“You are not alone” message

List of Counseling & Support Resources:

College Counselor

Student Wellness Center

National Helpline (India examples):

Kiran Helpline: 1800-599-0019

Sneha Foundation

Local Emergency Services

Encourage reaching out to:

Family

Friends

Academic mentors

⚠️ Phrase everything responsibly:

“This tool highlights risk patterns, not diagnoses.”

This single section will massively boost evaluation impression.

📊 ANALYTICS DASHBOARD (EXAM CRITICAL)

Create a separate Analytics tab that visualizes model insights, not raw data.

Mandatory Charts:
1️⃣ Model Summary Cards

Total Features: 51

Positive Coefficients

Negative Coefficients

Risk Levels: 3

2️⃣ Signed Coefficient Bar Chart

Top 15 coefficients

Red bars = risk increasing

Green bars = risk reducing

Clearly labeled feature names

3️⃣ Risk vs Protective Comparison

Side-by-side bars

Show magnitude difference

Explain:

“Positive coefficients increase risk score”

“Negative coefficients act as protective factors”

4️⃣ Top 10 Risk Factors List

Derived directly from Logistic Regression coefficients:

Academic Pressure (High)

Stress Level (High)

Hopelessness (High)

Lack of Support

Poor Sleep

5️⃣ Top 10 Protective Factors List

Low Stress

Strong Support Network

Openness to Help

Adequate Sleep

Financial Stability

Include an “About the Model” Section:

Explain clearly:

Logistic Regression chosen for interpretability

Coefficients used for insight

ROC-AUC indicates ranking ability

Model is probabilistic, not deterministic

🎨 UI / UX REQUIREMENTS

Dark theme

Subtle gradients

Hover effects on cards

Smooth page transitions

Animated charts on load

Professional academic look, not flashy startup hype

🧠 TONE & FRAMING RULES

Never claim medical diagnosis

Always use words like:

“risk”

“early signal”

“pattern-based”

Emphasize care, support, and ethical usage

🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

No deep learning

No new datasets

No real-time backend inference

No medical claims

No over-engineering beyond notebook scope

✅ FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Generate:

Clean, readable frontend code

Modular components

Charts wired to model coefficient data

A dashboard that looks far more advanced than typical student projects, yet remains academically honest

This dashboard should make an evaluator think:

“This student understands not just ML, but responsible deployment.”
