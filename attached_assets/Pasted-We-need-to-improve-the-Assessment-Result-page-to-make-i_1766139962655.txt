We need to improve the Assessment Result page to make it more dashboard-like, compact, and visually explainable.

Layout changes (very important)

Replace the current long vertical layout with a horizontal, 3-column responsive layout:

Left column (Prediction Summary)

Risk Level badge (Low / Medium / High)

Model Confidence as categorical label (High / Medium / Low), NOT percentage

Small donut or gauge showing relative risk tier

Middle column (Why This Result)

Visual explanations using charts

Right column (What You Can Improve)

Actionable suggestions with impact indicators

The entire key insight section should be visible above the fold on laptop screens, minimizing scrolling.

Make insights more visual (core requirement)

Add the following visual explainability components using the existing model logic:

1) Risk Contribution Waterfall Chart

Show how each major factor pushed the risk up or down

X-axis: factors like Sleep, Outdoor Activity, Stress, Academic Pressure, Support

Positive bars increase risk (red)

Negative bars reduce risk (green)

Label each bar with "+ impact" or "- impact"

This should directly reflect how the logistic regression model combines features.

2) Lifestyle Balance Radar Chart

Axes:

Sleep

Screen Time

Outdoor Activity

Stress Level

Academic Pressure

Overlay:

User’s current values

Ideal / healthy baseline

This gives an instant holistic view of imbalance.

3) Before vs Improve Mini Comparison

For top 2 improvable factors:

Current value vs suggested target

Use small horizontal bar comparisons

Example: Outdoor Activity: 1 hr → 3 hrs

Improve explanation tone (important)

Explanations must feel causal and grounded, not generic AI text

Use language like:

“Based on patterns learned from 10,000 student profiles…”

“Students with similar sleep and outdoor patterns showed lower predicted risk…”

Explicitly mention this is a logistic regression model, not a black box

Model confidence section update

Replace numeric confidence with:

“Model Confidence: High”

Subtext:

“Trained on 10,000 student profiles”

“ROC-AUC: 0.925”

“Prediction reflects statistical patterns, not diagnosis”

UI/UX polish

Keep dark theme consistent

Use subtle animations on charts

Add tooltips explaining each chart in simple student language

Ensure mobile responsiveness but optimize primarily for desktop web demo

Constraints

Do NOT introduce new ML models

Use existing notebook logic and saved pickle model

Keep everything aligned with the current dataset and metrics

This is an academic + demo dashboard, not a clinical product

The goal is to make the result page feel like a real explainable AI dashboard that clearly answers:

What is the risk?

Why did the model say this?

What can be realistically improved next?
